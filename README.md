# viand-platform
A Restaurant management System (College Project)

Viand Platform ("Viand":  A dish / Food Menu)

Menu management for restaurants is a very expensive process, due to costs of making the menu, 
	indirect costs like varying commodity prices, ability to react to consumer feedback and 
	unavailability of certain items due to unforeseen circumstances.
	
 Viand Platform will give restaurants an ability to manage menus dynamically and also enhances 
 the guest experience at the restaurant.
 The guest will browse the digital menu using android application.
